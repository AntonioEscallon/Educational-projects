Names: Noa Don and Antonio Escallon:

Noteworthy resources/consulations: We used the slides to guide our implementation of the value iteration algorithm. Also we talked to Harold Thidemann's group about when exactly "stabilization" occured (ie is does the stabilization occur on the iteration which is the same as the subsequent iterations or is it the next iteration afterwards which indicates stabilization). We then decided that stabilization meant stabilization occurs on the iteration which is the same as the subsequent iterations. Harold and his partner also wanted me to note here that they had already submitted their readme.txt and therefore this discussion wasn't mentioned in their submission.

We also believe we got everything working correctly.
